|############ A Mine ##############|
|== A PixelCat Engine Video Game ==|
\----------------------------------/

++ High Level Concept ++

-inspired by Kingdom (video game)
-dwarven mine managed by a dwarven lord, run by various dwarves
-2d side view section of a mine with horizontal + vertical panning
-low-fi pixel art + simple low-fi soundtrack, most likely
-dwarven lord is the only directly controllable part of the game, most actions in game are done by proxy through the dwarven lord's delegations
-hire dwarves to live in your mine
-dwarves come to your mine to be hired or can be found in places throughout the mine + hired
-build tools /buildings for mining ore + gem deposits + set up mining outposts to gather materials
-ore + gem deposits will be depleted un moderate time requiring further exploration to find new ones
-ore + gems get collected for (1) normal investments (ore), (2) special investments (gems) + (3) accumilating mine wealth (ore + gems)
-investments are done in various locations on the map by travelling to them + spending ore + gems
-mine wealth brings new dwarves, unlocks tech, etc.
-mines are plauged in cycles by hordes + disasters
-hordes can be defended against + fought off
-disasters can be prevented/minimalized by tech
-relics can be found + recovered in the mines for special benifits
-dwarves need to be fed or they will abandon the mine
-food is generated by constructed tech/buildings for farms
-mining outposts, farms, mine infrastructure + defenses all will be impaced by hordes + disasters + must be simultaneously attended to
